The pathfinder visualizes the underlying process to find the path for all the effective algorithms(Astar, Dijkstra's, Breadth-first and Depth-first). It is built upon the SFML framework and uses premake to organize the project.
The project served me to understand how to convert mathematical algorithms/theories into functional code. It also allowed me to explore a new framework(SFML) and design patterns(strategy, facade and adapter- used in the project). I encourage you to download the project and tinker with it.
